/sys/kernel/debug/vmtool/vmcs-addrs (ro):
	read(): return comma separated list of physical addresses of vmcs's
/sys/kernel/debug/vmtool/vmcs (rw):
	read(): return raw bytes of vmcs pointed to by the address last written to this file
	write(physical address): physical address of vmcs to read
/sys/kernel/debug/vmtool/msr/vmx-basic (ro):

todo:
----

1. implement read() for vmcs and vmcs_addrs
2. add readme which includes future plans
3. simple user space utility in python
