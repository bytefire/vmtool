"... the Purpose of the System is - whatever it can be used for."
- John Gall, The Systems Bible

At the moment this tool is a way to learn and explore virtualisation at
architecture level, i.e. agnostic of hypervisors like KVM and Xen. What shape
this will actually take is not decided yet. The only guarantee is that this
will be related to virtualisation. If you have any ideas, please do suggest
them either by emailing me at okash.khawaja@gmail.com or in the "Issues"
section of this GitHub project.

Currently this targets Intel 64 only but ultimately this will address other
architectures also.

This is work in progress, so interfaces will definitely change. Hope is that
they will stabilise soon. Also as WIP, it is not thread safe yet. The code
isn't immune to bugs when debug files are concurrently opened and acccessed
from user space. There are plans to deal with this and other limitations in
comments inside the code.
