- i started writing this for my own learning and as a way to explore virtualisation at architecture level. currently intended to be one stop shop for all things related to virtualisation at _architecture level_, i.e. agnostic of hypervisors like xen and kvm. what shape this actually takes is not decided yet. for example this might be part of some research or end up fulfilling some different use case. the only guarantee is that this will be related to virtualisation. if you have any ideas, please do suggest them either by emailing me at okash.khawaja@gmail.com or in the "Issues" section of this project.
