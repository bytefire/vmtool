"... the Purpose of the System is - whatever it can be used for."
- John Gall, The Systems Bible

At the moment this tool is a way to learn and explore virtualisation at
architecture level. It is currently intended to be one stop shop for all things
related to virtualisation at _architecture level_, i.e. agnostic of hypervisors
like KVM and Xen. What shape this will actually take is not decided yet. For
example, this may become part of some research or end up fulfilling a different
use case. The only guarantee is that this will be related to virtualisation. If
you have any ideas, please do suggest them either by emailing me at
okash.khawaja@gmail.com or in the "Issues" section of this GitHub project.

Currently this targets Intel 64 only but ultimately this will address other
architectures also.

This is work in progress, so interfaces will definitely change. Hope is that
they will stabilise soon. As WIP, the problems it has include thread-safety.
At the moment, the code isn't immune to bugs when debug files are concurrently
opened and acccessed from user space. There are plans to deal with this and
other limitations in comments inside the code.
