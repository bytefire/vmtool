i am writing this for my own learning and as a way to explore virtualisation at architecture level. currently intended to be one stop shop for all things related to virtualisation at _architecture level_, i.e. agnostic of hypervisors like xen and kvm. what shape this actually takes is not decided yet. for example this might be part of some research or end up fulfilling some different use case. the only guarantee is that this will be related to virtualisation. if you have any ideas, please do suggest them either by emailing me at okash.khawaja@gmail.com or in the "Issues" section of this github project.

currently this targets intel 64 only but ultimately this will address other architectures also, specifically AMD and ARM.

this is work in progress, so interfaces will definitely change. hope is that they will stabilise soon. also as WIP, the problems it has includes thread-safety. at the moment, the code isn't immune to bugs when debug files are concurrently opened and acccessed from user space. there are plans to deal with this and other limitations in comments inside the code.
